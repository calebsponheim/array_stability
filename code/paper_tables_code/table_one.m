function table_one(array_data)


% get all array names

% for each array in the list of array names
%    add a field in this new table for the array name

%    add a field to its left for the array's owner (gotta do some text
%    parsing here, probably, but it'll be easy because you name your sheets
%    consistently)

%    get a count of all the times that array name shows up using logical indexing
%    
%    then, figure out how to get the other array characteristics and info
%    into this format. you only have to do it a couple times! Another
%    import script? Ughh
%    
%%

% At some point, save the table you've made as a .mat file

% IMPORTANT: create a uifigure first using uifigure(), or else none of this
% will work

% use uitable to great a table gui object, to then save as a png to add to
% the manuscript

% use addStyle and uistyle to create and add formatting flourishes to make
% it paper-ready, but automated.
